### Job Position Manager   

#### **Introduction**  
The **Job Position Manager** is a Java-based application designed to streamline the recruitment process by leveraging the capabilities of a **PriorityQueue** (heap data structure). It automates the organization and prioritization of job positions, ensuring that critical roles are addressed first. The tool is particularly useful for HR teams and recruiters, helping them save time and improve efficiency while providing a fair process for applicants.

#### **Features and Capabilities**  
The Job Position Manager offers the following key functionalities:  
1. **Add Job Positions**: Users can add new job positions, specifying their priority and required experience.  
2. **View Job Queue**: Allows users to view the current list of job positions, automatically sorted by priority.  
3. **Process Job Positions**: Enables users to process and remove the highest-priority position from the queue.  
4. **Dynamic Updates**: Automatically reorders job positions as new ones are added or processed, ensuring real-time prioritization.  
5. **Educational Utility**: Provides a practical example of how heap data structures are applied in real-world applications.

#### **Purpose and Contribution**  
**Why did we make this application?**  
The Job Position Manager was created to address common challenges in the hiring process, such as:  
- **Manual Sorting**: Traditional job prioritization is often time-consuming and prone to human error.  
- **Critical Roles Delays**: Important roles can be overlooked in manual systems, causing delays in the hiring process.  
- **Learning Opportunity**: Developers can learn how to apply and implement heap-based data structures in practical scenarios.  

**How does it contribute?**  
1. **To the HR Community**:  
   - **Efficiency**: Automates prioritization, saving time and effort for HR teams.  
   - **Fairness**: Ensures that job prioritization is consistent and unbiased.  
2. **To Developers**:  
   - Offers a clear example of how PriorityQueue (heap) can be used in real-world applications.  
   - Promotes a deeper understanding of data structures and algorithms through practical usage.  
3. **To Job Applicants**:  
   - Enhances fairness in job prioritization, ensuring critical positions are addressed promptly.
